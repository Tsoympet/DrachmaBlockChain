# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security and consensus safety seriously. Please report suspected vulnerabilities **privately** and **do not** open public issues.

- **Preferred contact:** security@drachma.org
- **Alternate:** GitHub "Report a vulnerability" (Security tab) when available
- **GPG:** A project signing key will be published; until then, request a fingerprint in your initial email if encrypted communication is required.

Provide as much detail as possible, including:
- A description of the issue and potential impact (especially consensus divergence or DoS)
- A minimal reproduction, logs, or proof-of-concept if available
- Affected versions/commit hashes and environment details

## Response Process

1. We will acknowledge receipt within **3 business days**.
2. The issue will be triaged for severity and impact, with priority given to consensus and remote exploitation risks.
3. You will receive updates as remediation progresses. Coordinated disclosure timelines will be agreed upon before public release.
4. Credit will be given to reporters who request it, unless anonymity is preferred.

## Scope

- Consensus logic, networking, wallet services, miners, build scripts, and release artifacts.
- Documentation that could mislead users in a way that impacts security.

## Out of Scope

- Third-party pools or forks not maintained in this repository.
- Hypothetical attacks without actionable details.

Thank you for helping keep DRACHMA users safe.
